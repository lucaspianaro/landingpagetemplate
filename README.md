## Usage

### Adding Content

- **Data Management**: All content (text, icons, links, etc.) is managed through the `data/data.json` file. Update this file with the relevant information for your business.

### Customizing the Theme

- The theme is defined in `src/common/theme.js`. You can customize the colors, typography, and other styling elements to match your branding.

### Customizing Components

- Each section of the website is a separate React component located in the `src/components/` directory. These components receive data via props, making them easy to reuse and customize.

## Folder Structure

Here is an overview of the project structure:

```
/src
  /common
    theme.js             # Custom Material-UI theme
  /components
    Header.js            # Hero section component
    Footer.js            # Footer component
    Features.js          # Features section component
    About.js             # About section component
    Navigation.js        # Navigation bar component
    Services.js          # Services section component
    Testimonials.js      # Testimonials section component
    Contact.js           # Contact section component
  /data
    data.json            # JSON file containing all the content data
  App.js                 # Main application component
  index.js               # Entry point of the application
```

## Customization

- **Theme Customization**: Modify the `theme.js` file to change the overall look and feel of the application.
- **Component Customization**: Components can be edited in the `src/components/` directory to change the layout, add new features, or adjust styling.
- **Data Customization**: Update `data.json` to reflect your company's services, testimonials, and contact information.

## Data Management

The content of the website is controlled via the `data.json` file. This allows for easy updates and scalability:

- **header**: Controls the main title and description on the homepage.
- **features**: Lists key features or services offered by the company.
- **about**: Contains the company description and reasons why customers should choose your services.
- **services**: Lists detailed services provided.
- **testimonials**: Contains customer feedback and testimonials.
- **contact**: Stores contact information such as address, phone, and email.

## Deployment

   ```
   This command will create an optimized production build in the `build` directory.

2. **Install Firebase CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Login to Firebase**:
